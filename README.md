# Frontend Vue Developer Test

This project is built as part of a technical interview test for a frontend engineer position. It demonstrates the use of modern frontend technologies (VueJs,Typescript,Scss ) to create an interactive, responsive, and scalable web application(dashboard). The project adheres to best practices in code organization, component-based architecture, and performance optimization.


## Demo

## Features
- Dashboard sidebar component
- Charts
- Resuable card components
- Data Table
- Search Feature
- Pagination

## Technologies Used
- **Vuejs:** For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript:** Ensuring type safety and reducing runtime errors.
- **Vuetify:** Open Source UI Library with beautifully handcrafted Vue Components
- **Vite:** For a fast and optimized development experience 


## Run Locally

Clone Project Repo 

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sammy-code98/tesla-dashboard.git
   ```

Navigate to Project Directory
```bash
cd  project-name
```

Install dependencies 

```bash
  yarn install
  ```

 ## Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```



## Improvements and Next Steps
- **Add Testing:** Improve coverage for edge cases and asynchronous flows
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that all UI components are accessible with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- **SEO:** Implement better SEO practices (e.g., meta tags, alt attributes for images).
- **Custom Component:** Add more custom component to match the once depicted on the figma design(eg,the select/dropdown component) 
- **Design System:** Introduce a design system for components across all boards.
- **State Management:** Use vuex or pinia to manage more complex and global state.
